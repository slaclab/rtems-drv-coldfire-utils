	* flash.c: Need to include <unistd.h> under rtems-4.10 in order to
	silence compiler warning.

2010/03/17 (T.S.)

	* drv5282QSPI.c: revert using a binary semaphore and drop priority
	inheritance instead. The mutex is also used for synchronization
	and released by ISR which will fail if ISR executes from a
	different task context (binary/prio semaphore must be obtained/released
	by same task).

2009/12/07 (T.S.)

	* drv5282DMA.c: fixed compiler warnings (print formats).

2009/10/17 (T.S.)

	* drv5282QSPI.c: must use a binary (not simple binary) semaphore
	for mutex - otherwise there is no priority inheritance and creation
	fails under 4.10.
